Looking for a maintainer to take control of this project and move it forward. As I no longer work with magento, I don't have time to improve it or debug issues. Anyone interested, post your availability here: https://github.com/ClaudiuCreanga/magento2-store-locator-stockists-extension/issues/30

Or you can download the latest zip file from releases, drop it into your app folder, copy the contents of src folder into the main folder and then run the last 2 commands above.

Or you can also get it from the <a href="https://marketplace.magento.com/limesharp-stockists.html"> magento2 marketplace.</a> (there it is the old version 1.0.6 with less features)

It requires magento 2.1 or above and php7 (for php5.6 use v.1.0.6).

<b>You need to use your own gmaps api key</b>. Go to https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/get-api-key and get your own key and then insert it in configuration > stockists > Gmaps Api Key. Otherwise the map may not work because of Gmaps' daily limits.

## Usage

### Basic

* The default url is /stockists. So once installed go to www.website.com/stockists (insert store code if necessary);
* Location in admin is inside content menu > stockists;
* Name, latitude and longitude are required values;
* Bear in mind that chrome and some other browsers allow geolocation services only via https;

### Import

* The csv file needs to be comma separated and values should be quoted;
* check the sample csv file in in <a href="https://github.com/ClaudiuCreanga/magento2-store-locator-stockists-extension/tree/master/docs">docs folder</a>;
* name, latitude and longitude are required;
* country field should be the 2 letter ISO code. Example: GB for United Kingdom and US for USA;
* image should be the path of the image which is built from the first to letters separated by slash and then the name of the image. Example: for image test.png the path is /t/e/test.png. The image should be placed in folder pub/media/limesharp_stockists/stockist/image/t/e/ (last 2 letters changed of course);
* if you want a stockist to be in multiple stores you can pass the ids of stores comma separated inside the store_id field;
* To make sure your csv file is formatted correctly, you can open it in a text editor. It should look like this (comma separated and quoted values):

![csv](docs/images/csv.jpg?raw=true "CSV")

### Export

* Just click export stores and a file will be saved by your browser on your computer;

## Support
* I **DO NOT** offer any free technical support in installing or customizing this extension.
* This extention works out of the box with any magento 2.1 site, but depending on your theme it may need further styling.
